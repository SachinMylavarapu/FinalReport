\begin_layout Standard
As is evident, sleep apnea, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects
 a significant proportion of the population and is worthy of attention.
 The current available diagnosis options for sufferers or potential sufferers
 are limited, expensive, invasive and realtively inaccessible.
 We outline below the most common sources of help and diagnosis for potential
 sufferers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
NHS - GP check-up, home devices and polysomnography (PSG)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Commercial home-testing devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other possible future options such as mobile sleep apps and non-contact
 health sensing technologies

\begin_layout Subsection
NHS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the NHS guidelines, patients who believe they may be suffering
 from sleep apnea can schedule a visit to their GP.
 The GP will ask a few questions to determine the likelihood of apnea, along
 with a physical examination that includes a blood pressure (BP) test and
 a hypothyroidism test, to determine whether an underactive thyroid gland
 is the reason for the patient's tiredness.
 The patient can then choose if he/she would like to be observed for one
 night in a sleep centre, or would like to be given a monitoring device
 to wear at home when sleeping.
 Those who opt for a home sleep study are required to visit the sleep centre
 at a convenient time to collect and learn how to use the portable recording
 equipment.
 These include breathing sensors, heart rate monitors and oxygen sensors.
 Information from the device can be analysed on the next visit and further
 action, such as referring to a sleep centre can be taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observation at a sleep centre is done through polysomnography (PSG).
 This involves electrodes being placed on the face, scalp and above the
 lips, and bands being placed around the chest and abdomen.
 Additionally, sensors are placed on the legs and an oxygen sensor is attached
 to a finger.
 The tests carried out during a PSG include:

\begin_layout Itemize
Recording of oronasal airflow

\begin_layout Itemize
Pulse Oximetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Electrocardiography (ECG)
\end_layout

Sound and Video Recording
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data from these tests is used to positively diagnose obstructive sleep
 apnea and a treatment regimen is then decided upon and enforced by the
 healthcare professional.
 For the purposes of this report, we shall not delve into the treatment
 of OSA - we concern ourselves with the diagnosis process and how we can
 improve it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Commercial home-testing devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these devices are more commmon in the United States, they are also
 available in the UK, and can be purchased if desired without visiting a
 GP.
 An example of such home-testing devices is the AccuSom

\begin_layout Standard
The prevalence of such tests in the U.S.
 points towards the increasing unfeasiblity of sleep centre tests for simple
 diagnosis of OSA, and is an indication of where the diagnosis process is
 headed in the future, in the U.K.
 as well as around the world.
 The economic reasons for the trend are clear.
 On average, a single night at a sleep centre and the associated tests could
 cost from $800 to $3000 in the U.S.
 (figures for the NHS in the U.K.
 are more difficult to find, but should be comparable) The home tests can
 be administered at a fraction of that price, ranging from $200 to $600.
 Moreover, sleep centre tests are extremely inconvenient for the patients,
 and hence should be administered towards the later stages of the diagnosis
 process.
 The use of home-testing devices also allows a larger percentage of the
 population to be able to test for OSA, which is desirable given that around
 1 in 5 suffer from OSA.

Other options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trend towards greater user independence in OSA diagnosis is further
 observed through two major related breakthroughs - the rise of mobile sleep
 apps and the development of non-contact health sensing technologies.
