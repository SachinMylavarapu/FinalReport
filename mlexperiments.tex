\section{Machine Learning -- Experiments}

\paragraph{}
	We obtained the data from the ECG database from the PhysioNet database located at \url{http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/}. The data consists of 35 labelled training records and 35 unlabelled records (used for the CinC Challenge 2000 competition). The recordings vary from less than 7 hours to 10 hours each and include continuous digitised ECG signal and, in the case of the training data, a set of appnoea annotations derived by human experts.
