\subsection{Summary}

We have seen the implementation of the SVM and HMM models to the PhysioNet data and have calculated the accuracy of both methods in diagnosing apnoea from five records. On the surface, while it may seem that the SVM model provides us with higher accuracy, we feel that the HMM model is more appropriate for use in our app. The accuracy can be improved, firstly, by using more data (we only used 10 of the 35 files for testing) and secondly, by ensuring that the annotations on training and testing data reflect the reality of the patient.

What we have managed to prove here, however, is that diagnosis of OSA using non-invasive techinques is possible if the appropriate machine learning tools are utilised. If more resources were to be invested, an accurate and comprehensive diagnosis can be created in conjunction with the questionnaire.
