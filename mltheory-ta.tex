\subsection{Machine Learning -- Theory}

\paragraph{}
	Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data \cite{wiki:machineLearning}. The supervised classification problem in machine learning concerns finding the unknown target function that classifies certain input data into classes based on some set of training examples containing labelled input data.
