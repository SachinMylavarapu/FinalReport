\subsubsection*{State-Space Models}

\paragraph{}
	Here, we present the State-Space Models (SSMs) (also known as Linear Dynamical Systems) based on Kevin Murphy's book \cite[Chapter 18]{mlBook}. SSMs allow us to model systems that are dynamic. Unlike the SVMs, SSMs will model dependencies of the current state on the previous ones.
